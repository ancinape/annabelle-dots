# Annabelle's dots
Dotfiles for a simple and purple-ish i3 setup.

Princess Annabelle is the nickname of one of my laptops. It was the first device I installed Linux on. Thus, many of these dotfiles still have their original comments and defaults.

I used to be in a Star Wars phase. There are accents of the Empire (in [blurlock](/i3/blurlock) and [workspaces](/polybar/config)) in Annabelle.
